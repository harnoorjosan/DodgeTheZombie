# DodgeTheZombie
Problem representation, heuristics and search

A team of researchers is fleeing from zombies in a dark forest late at night. They reach a rope bridge spanning a ravine, knowing that if they can all cross before the zombies catch up, they'll survive.

The bridge allows at most two individuals to cross simultaneously, but those crossing must have the flashlight with them. Since there's only one flashlight for the group, someone must return it to the starting side before others can cross. Additionally, each pair moves at the speed of its slowest member.

Here are the time intervals for each person to cross:

The Undergrad: 1 minute
The Grad Student: 2 minutes
The Postdoc: 5 minutes
The Professor: 10 minutes

How can the whole group get to the other side of the bridge in the shortest possible time?
